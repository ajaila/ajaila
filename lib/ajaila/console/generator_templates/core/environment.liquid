# Global Constants:
# 
# Here you can specify global constants, which are available across 
# the application. 
#
# Example:
#  FOO = "something bad"
#  
# After initializing constant FOO - you have a chance to refer to this
# constant through miners, helpers, selectors and presenters.
#
# 
#
# Additional Libraries:
#
# If you want to extend your application with additional libraries (Gems), you
# can add gems here.
#  
# Example:
#   require "statsample"
#
# Don't forget to add gems to the Gemfile and run command `bundle install`.
